# The Architect (rough draft)

He held down a finger-twisting key combination with one hand and scrolled back on the mouse with the other. The representation of his building on the screen panned smoothly around in response. This building was a perfect thing. Well, it was perfect to him. Inevitably its perfection would be hindered and potentially ruined by all the various building codes, engineering specifications, insurance requirements, cost overruns, and last minute C-of-O demands. But that was all later. Right now was the moment he savored most as an architect: the building had been approved as designed, contracts were being drawn up, things were in motion. The building would get built, and for now for all anyone knew it would be built as he had imagined it.

And this building was one he was particularly proud of. It wasn't his first tower in a major world city, but it was the tallest and largest by floor area his firm had ever done. The firm was too large for him to work on every building, so lesser buildings were executed by the talented young folks who worked for him. But this building was to be their flagship. It represented a frankly frightening number billable hours from the last five years that he had spent in front of this CAD software, carefully refining every detail, every approach, every material that would be used in the building. He was the lone genius in the corner office, carefully creating the vision he wanted to thrust into the world.

He made one more pass around the building in the software. It was so tall: just under a quarter-mile, rising out of the flat plane of the street below. Ramrod straight up through the structure went the spine of the building core containing the high-speed elevator banks and building systems. With some of the layers turned off in the software he could admire hardness that the core represented. The design left no compromise to the strength of the building. He was confident it would stand powerfully erect for a hundred years or more.

He re-enabled the exterior layers and the glass curtain-walls melted into view reinforcing the exterior shape of the floors. The floors were offset along the whole length of the perfectly straight central core. This was the aspect of the building he was most proud of. The offset floors gave the building a delicate, wide arc that curved from the base all the way to the penthouses. The fatter commercial floors on the bottom grew slowly smaller in floor area as the building gained height and transitioned to residential. From certain angles it looked like the entire building was built on an expensive-to-execute curve, but that was an illusion that belied the straight central core that allowed a single fast elevator ride from the base to the top.

As he had worked on it he also decided he didn't want the building to just narrow to a point like some kind of specialty sewing needle. It had needed something more at the top. Something to give it some weight and presence. So he had designed the upper floors to suddenly gain width again, bulbing out from the smaller floors 9/10ths of the way up the building, and then curving slowly back together and over the top of the building. It was shockingly effective. Like no other tower around. And the penthouses at the point where the building bulbed out were designed with dizzying and wealthy-people-impressing views straight down the side of the building. The people living in those units would be able to look literally down on the world at their feet.

A perfect building, from tip to base. His masterpiece. And it was going to be built. He couldn't be happier. 

There was a knock at his door, and since he had left it partially open his lead designer took the liberty of stepping in without waiting for an invitation. He was a young clean-shaven man wearing a conservative but expensive three-piece suit cut in the modern fashion. He was holding a model of the building in his hands, both hands wrapped carefully around it to assure it would not be damaged in transit. "Sir, the interns finished printing the latest model for the contextual neighborhood view. I brought it right up as you asked.

"Terrific! Here, let me see it. I want to see how much detail we managed to get at 1:1000 scale."

"Can I ask what that new base section is for? I hadn't seen that previously."

"I want to try designing a new vibration dampener solution. There's various different ways we can approach that. In fact here, let me show you.

He reached into his drawer and pulled out a set of leather straps with buckles. "Do you recognize this?"

"Uh.. maybe, I think it's umm.."

"Surely a attractive young man like yourself isn't spending all his time cooped up in this architecture office. You do get out once in a while don't you?"

"Well, of course sir, I mean you _do_ keep us busy, and the work is the important thing, but um..."

"Look, you've been here for a while. But this building, this tower, this is the first major project we've completed together, right? What do you think of this building?"

"I think it's perfect sir, a real masterpiece. I think you'll be written about in all the major press. I think you'll be invited onto the lecture circuit at all the top schools. I think this building is a landmark in the history of architecture. [list some related landmark buildings here -- architect fan service]"

"I think there's little that could be said to diminish its prominence as well. And I don't say that lightly. But do you see how all the attention comes to me? Even the way you just phrased those sentences of praise --- it was all about me. But a building like this isn't really the work of one person. It's the work of a team. More than a team, it's the work of a community. A city. Sometimes even a nation. And I like to celebrate that work with my team. I like to pass along at least some of the glory to everyone."

The architect held the model firmly and aligned the base with the leather harness. He snapped the oddly-shaped bottom of the model into the harness. Then he stood and stepped around the large mid-century wooden desk. He handed the harness with the model attached to it to the young man. He began to unzip his trousers.

"I want you to attach that to me."

"Um.."

"Get on your knees while you do it."

"Umm..." The young designer looked very unsure, but slowly sank to his knees, the fabric of his expensive suit pushing into the carpet. He wrapped the harness around his boss, and buckled it.

"Tighter." He shifted his cock into the space inside the harness for it and the young man tightened the leather straps by one notch.

"Now. Put your lips on the tip of my building. Our building."

He kiss the tip of the building, then slowly let his lips fall open, and he slowly took the wide tip of the model into his mouth. He concentrated as he breathed through his angular nose.

The architect put his hand on the young man's head and drove the building down his throat. "You love our building?" 

The young man nodded vigorously.

"Good! Come up here."

The young man stood, and the architect put his hand on the back of his head and pushed it down against the lightly stained hardwood of his mid-century desk. "Undo your pants and let them down."

While the young man did so, the architect dipped his fingers into a tub of thick greasy lube that had sat unnoticed near his keyboard. He spread it thick all along the length of the hard resinous model and up over the tip of the building. "Take a deep breath!" And holding the ass cheeks wide, he shoved the model of his building up the young designers rear. "God fucking damn! The muscles of your legs! So fucking taught! And look at the definition of your ass! You must not be sitting at your desk enough. You must have time to work out!"

"Yes sir!"

The architect slid his hands over the young designer's suit. "I love your muscle tone! I used to have tone like that. But I let it go to dedicate my life to my work. On the other hand... you feel how hard my work is? You can't get _that_ kind of strength from muscle tone!"

"That's right sir!"

"Here, let me help you out."

The architect reached around and took the young designer's cock in his hand, and with every thrust of his building deep into the young man's hard body, he have a hard greasy stroke to his cock. Soon the young man was spilling his jizz all over the carpet. "Excellent! You really do love our building, don't you?"

"I do sir!"

"I appreciate that kind of dedication. Here's what I want you to do now.. no, no... yes, you can pull your pants up now. This is what I want you to do: go get the table moved out of the conference room. And then I want the whole team that worked on this tower assembled there in the next hour. OK?"

"OK sir! No problem."

Before an hour was up the architect was standing in front of the twenty some odd number of people on the design team. They were of all ages, men and women, but the median trended younger since it was cheaper to hire architects straight out of school. Experienced architects expected too much money and only did slightly better work, and less of it. Every one of them was dressed with that certain impeccable style that marked them as ivy league creatives --- each unique, to a point, though if you squinted they kind of all looked like they dressed the same.

"OK design team!" Said the architect. "Thank you for interrupting your work to gather here on short notice! I know it has been a long day already. But I thought we should take a moment to celebrate!" He could feel the model bulging in his pants, straining against the zipper for release. He was sure the team could all see it too. "...To celebrate the fruits of our labor!" He unzipped his pants and let the model fall out, the tiny perfectly-rendered details of his building standing out at sharp salute in front of him. "Now I know you all love your job here. Right?"

A murmured chorus of assent.

"If you don't love your job here, you can leave right now. The door is right there..."

Nobody moved.

"Good. OK then. Would you please all get on your knees in a line in front of me."

A rustle of tasteful fabrics, and a few groans as the whole crew lowered to their knees like some kind of choir.

"Now maybe you heard, I just fucked the lead designer in the ass with our building. I say _our_ building because we all worked on it together, right? And you loved getting fucked in the ass with _our_ building didn't you?" He looked over at the lead designer who nodded vigorously.

"But now our building needs a cleaning. I need you all to help me with this fun little project of cleaning our building. One at a time, OK? I'll start on the right here..."

The first person on his knees was a young woman with red hair, carefully straightened and with precisely clipped bangs, dressed in a blazer and skirt. The architect stood in front of her and she eyed the building. He put the model to her lips and she suddenly dove down on it with surprising eagerness. She sucked the whole thing down her throat, and gagged it back. Tears welled in the points of her eyes, and then she pulled her head back, a long thing string of saliva still connecting her to the highest point of the building.

"Oh my! You _do_ love our building don't you honey?"

She looked up at the architect grinning happily.

He moved onto the next person. Another attractive young man of Asian descent. He looked at the model hanging in the air in front of him with much more trepidation than his colleague, but he too managed to work up the courage to take it into his mouth and suck on it gently for a few minutes.

Next up was an older fellow who had been at the firm for a number of years. He had no hesitation at all, having been through this process a number of times. He eagerly lapped his tongue up and down the length of the building and then sucked it between his lips, his salt-and-pepper head bobbing back and forth rapidly along the shaft.

The architect made his way down the line. Not one of his staff shirked their responsibilities. He was proud of their dedication and team spirit. These were all true architects. By the end of the line, the model of his building was shining and clean and stood crisply white under the office track lighting.

"You are all so wonderful. I appreciate that you think so much of my vision, my genius. I'm proud to have you working for me. Someone get me an appointment with the mayor please!"

---

The next day the architect passed through the heavy dark-stained wood-paneled doors of the mayors office, closing the doors behind him. The mayor, sitting behind the heavy-wood desk, looked up from papers she was reviewing as he entered.

"Oh! I'm so glad you reached out to make an appointment." She said. "I have been meaning to meet with you. Your building is such an important project for our city."

"I am aware of that. We carefully designed the project so it would fit well into the small parcel we have allotted for it. But beyond even that, my designers have worked to make sure that every approach is considered. It isn't a building that will stand alone, not some monstrosity of ego, rather it is something that will reflect the city back on itself."

"You're not saying it's understated are you? It could hardly be called subtle...

"Not at all! No no. It is in fact intended to be the main feature of the city. The hallmark. The calling card. The icon. The shining beacon of the skyline. It will, I hope, eventually be the thing that your city is known for. I just mean that it's not _unconsidered_. It has a _relationship_ with the city, you know."

"Well, good. That's what I was hoping. The last thing we need is another understated building that blends without notice into the low-rise fabric of the city. Buildings without recognition are not the kinds of buildings that get one elected."

"Trust me Madam Mayor, when you cut the ribbon on my building, you will get nothing but recognition."

"I... maybe I shouldn't say this because it makes me look weak... this stays behind closed doors, OK? But I... I _need_ your building. It's just so... perfect."

"I know you need it Madam Mayor. And you will have it. There's just one thing I need you to do for me..." He unzipped his trousers and let the straining erect model spring to its full glory.

"Oh... is that it?"

"A model, of course. But look at it! It's perfection!" The architect and the mayor both gazed admiringly at it."

"So... what do you need from me?"

"I need you, Madam Mayor, to sit up on your desk."

The architect stepped towards the mayor, following the pointing form of his building around her desk. He undid the buttons on the blazer of her pantsuit, and then undid her blouse. "Take it in your hands." The architect commanded.

She wrapped both her hands around the model and felt the size of it filling and spilling beyond her palms. He released her tits from her bra, and she leaned over slightly and she guided the tip of the model up to her nipples, circling them slowly.

"God, I _love_ it." The mayor said. She unzipped her pants and slide them down with her panties. She kicked her heeled shoes off with her toes and let the pants drop to the floor. She leaned back and spread her legs wide. "I want that building in my city so badly! Give it to me!"

The architect took the building in his fist and pressed the bulging tip of his building up against the lips of the mayor's pussy.

"Just the thought of it, standing out there, it makes me so... so... wet."

"I can see that Madam Mayor." The architect said as he thrust the model up into the mayor. She let out a long exhale as if the filling length of the building was pushing the air out of her.

"Fuck me."

"I'm going to fuck you so hard. I'm going to fuck you completely over with my giant fucking building!" He grimaced and thrust into her. He pushed her back, and fucked her, mercilessly banging away. She spread her legs ever wider, wanting more of it up inside her. The lips of her pussy stretched wide.

"Got I want to accommodate your structure... your vision... your brilliant genius! Give me more! Please! More!"

And then there was a loud snap, and the architect fell suddenly forward no longer supported by the harness and the structure mounted to it.

"What... what happened?" Asked the Mayor.

"It broke. I broke my model on you." He slide it out of her, and it hung limply from the harness, the strong spine of its core snapped.

"Oh... how sad it looks."

"No matter!" Said the architect gesturing toward the open window. "Before long you will be able to gaze out your window at my full-sized building anyway!"
